                      The floor grows softer. The rain fills my pores and makes my skin heavy. I do not think of rescue, for my waterlogged skin weighs in on my senses and drapes over my brain like an enormous wet curtain. I do not move because the slightest tag may tear my lungs or liver or lumbar in two, yet the longer I stay under the shower, the softer I become.

                      Here I rest on the ground<br>
But maybe it’s for the best that I’m not found<br>
So far from my sunday best<br>
<br>
Truthlessly wound together<br>
Hopelessly - ropelessly found under the weather<br>
So far from better<br>
<br>
What a first impression this must be<br>
Reader and read<br>
Lying through my teeth and laying on my head<br>

                  <center>  
                      
                      Mangled, deformed, grotesque,<br>
A lost memory of art,<br>
Left with none to see or check,<br>
What wisdom I may impart. <br>
                      <br>
Is it odd to say I’m almost glad?<br>
Perhaps it was wrong of me to think of myself,<br>
As anything but a passing fad,<br>
With a permanent home upon a shelf.<br>

                      
                  </center>
              </div>   
              
              
              <div class=container>

                      I do not hold a shimmering lake or a haunting castle. My inside cover does not show a map of any expansive world. I hold no secrets for the world. I hold no hidden knowledge. I understand. I know why I have been lost to the gutters and dusty corners. If the only wisdom I can share is the stories we’ve all read hundreds of times before, why would one choose me? The novels we all know and love, reread and study. Marks made upon the page from lovers and students. 
But I know I have a purpose. If only one — just one, is all I ask — person looked at the words written hastily upon my pages… I am here for a reason. Let me prove it.

              </div>           
              
                            <div class=container>
                  <center>  
                      
                      Such potential lies within these cardboard walls, only to be forgotten. Is it my destiny to be abandoned and perish as a forgotten thought? My core, once filled with beauty and elegance, now melts away to never be seen again. Am I the one at fault for my demise? Was I meant to be left astray and absorbed by the earth, from which I became? My dreams of adventure and pleasure can inspire if given a glance.

                  <center>  
                      
                      Rejected and neglected, <br>
I drown in the perilous shallows.<br>
My hopes from when I was erected,<br>
Have now succumbed to the fury of the gallows.<br>
<br>
My dying wish is to be loved,<br>
Something unfamiliar since creation.<br>
I now wallow in my home of mud and blood,<br>
Never to spark imagination, for I was lost in translation.<br>

              <center>
                  Something is off<br>
                  My left-side cuffs<br>
                  And faux folios<br>
                  Bind me to no rocks<br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Adorned with header<br>
                  And digital leather<br>
                  Oh boy,<br>
                  I will live forever<br>
